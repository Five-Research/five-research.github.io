		<p><img src="images/future.png" alt="where we are headed" /></p>
		<p>For any society there are only three main sources of growth:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Population growth</li>
			<li>Natural resource utilization</li>
			<li>Technology.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			However, both population and natural resources face constraints,
			both real or political. This leaves us with one truly boundless
			source of growth: technology. The transcendence of technology in
			daily lives is inevitable.
		</p>
		<h3 id="it-s-the-dawn-of-a-new-age">It&#39;s the dawn of a new age</h3>
		<p>
			We stand at the beginning of a transformative era. Widespread
			adoption of technology is set to reshape culture, society, and the
			global political economy. Technology is not just an enabler of
			innovation—it is the very foundation of humanity’s advancement and
			will remain so for generations to come.
		</p>
		<p>
			Artificial Intelligence lies at the heart of this transformation. As
			the next logical step in societal evolution, it holds the key for
			unlocking new levels of progress. The human mind and its various
			quirks are what led our species to the place we are in right now;
			simulating it will be the key for further advancements.
		</p>
		<h3 id="-making-sand-think-">
			<strong><em>Making sand think</em></strong>
		</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Robotics and Super-scale computing</strong> will further
			accelerate this digital revolution. The world will be rewritten with
			new data structures and algorithms. Wars will no longer be fought
			with human soldiers—any civilization clinging to old ways will be
			left behind. With no human lives ever harmed, battle will become a
			game of pure strategy and technological prowess.
			<strong>And we are so in for robo-wars</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the only time in the history of humanity that we have had a
			singular all-supreme power state: The United States. Obviously, the
			US is here to stay; Rome did not fall in a day, neither is the US
			going to (anytime soon). But there will be uprisings from other
			parts of the world due to the leveraging effect of technology.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em><u>China, Europe, and India</u></em> will become major players on the
			world stage in the years to come due to their rapid adoption on
			technology.
		</p>
		<h3 id="-five-is-more-than-just-a-research-lab-">
			<strong><em>Five is more than just a research lab.</em></strong>
		</h3>
		<p>
			It&#39;s a front, an effort dedicated to the holistic enhancement of
			human potential through technological innovation.
			The goal here is not just to create cutting-edge models which
			obliterate all benchmarks but to make an <strong>impact</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			A tool is only as good as you use it, and we are here to
			<strong>change the future of humanity</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			It&#39;s a task easier said than done; open communication and
			collaboration were the core reasons we homo-sapiens developed into
			the species we are today. But this requires more, as the stakes are
			higher and the probability of doom is significantly raised. But
			what&#39;s fun without some existential risk?
		</p>
		<h2 id="our-mission">Our mission</h2>
		<p>
			At Five, we believe technology is inherently neutral—a powerful tool
			that can be wielded for both good and harm. Its impact depends on
			those who wield it. As Plato once questioned, who defines what is
			good or evil? It’s a fair debate, and while we don’t claim to have
			the answer, our mission is clear: to accelerate technology’s
			development and make it accessible to all, empowering society to
			decide for themselves. We believe the power of innovation shouldn’t
			reside in the hands of a select few, but in the hands of the many.
		</p>
		<h3 id="we-advocate-for-open-access-to-technology-for-all-humankind-">
			We advocate for open access to technology, for all humankind.
		</h3>
		<p>
			As we embark on this journey toward a more enlightened and advanced
			society, it is essential to delve into the core principles that
			underpin Five.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong><em>Civilization-scale growth:</em></strong> Growth; not
				just for a select few, but for everyone. Think of your gardener,
				your Amazon delivery driver, the local policeman dedicated to
				his community. These are the type of people who are generally
				left behind when large-scale adoption happens. We at Five are
				here to make sure that everyone—from every walk of life—has
				access to cutting-edge technology with
				<em>awesome designs</em> while we&#39;re at it.
			</li>
			<br/>
			<li>
				<strong><em>Transparency</em></strong>: We advocate for transparent
				research practices, informed consent, and the prioritizing the
				safety and well-being of all people. We are not here to take
				over the world, just to make it a better place for us and for
				both current and future generations.
			</li>
			<br/>
			<li>
				<strong><em>Teleological Alignment:</em></strong> Advanced AI
				systems are going to alter humanity&#39;s trajectory towards a
				collective purpose and goals; we have to ensure systems are
				built which do not take us down a road where future generations
				look back at us with regret.
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong><em>Abundance creation:</em></strong>
				</p>
				<p>To quote Marc Andreessen (@pmarca):</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Give us a real-world problem and we can invent technology that will solve it. 
						<br/>
						Starvation was a problem, so we invented the Green Revolution. 
						<br/>
						Darkness was a problem, so we invented electric lighting. 
						<br/>
						Diseases were a problem, so we invented vaccines. 
						<br/>
						The cold was a problem, so we invented indoor heating. 
						<br/>
						Heat was a problem, so we invented air conditioning. 
						<br/>
						Isolation was a problem, so we invented the Internet.
						<br/>
				</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Now we have a problem of poverty, so we
					<em>invent technology</em> to
					<strong>create abundance</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>Invention leads to creation</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong
						><em>Ethics of Artificial Consciousness:</em></strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					As we explore machine consciousness and Qualia, we must
					consider its ethical implications. How will creating a
					create sentient AI change society? What rights should be
					granted to artificial beings?
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong
						><em
							>The Dialectic of Human and Artificial
							Intelligence:</em
						></strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					The merging of humans and AI will give rise to entirely new
					beings—beings that may mirror the power of Greek legends. We
					must carefully navigate around this scenario so as to to
					avoid dystopian futures. Could this integration lead to a
					completely new form of consciousness?
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong
						><em
							>Philosophical Implications of Technological
							Singularity:</em
						></strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					What are the limits of human potential in a post-singularity
					world? Is AI truly the &quot;Last Invention&quot;? As we
					approach this tipping point, how do we ethically and
					philosophically prepare for a future we dont fully
					comprehend?
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 id="what-we-work-on-">What We Work On?</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong><em>Simulated Cognition Research</em></strong>: The human brain
				remains our greatest resource. Simulating its power is our best
				path forward. Can we find the function for Qualia?
			</li>
			<br/>
			<li>
				<strong><em>Rationality Computation</em></strong>: In ancient times,
				random acts may have worked, but in today’s world, rationality
				is critically important. We seek to develop formulas for
				decision-making rooted in logic, bringing reason to every
				action.
			</li>
			<br/>
			<li>
				<strong><em>Where Humanity Fits in:</em></strong> Like it or
				not, humans are here to stay and so is AI. In this new cyber
				age, how do we navigate forward keeping the scales balanced?
			</li>
			<br/>
			<li>
				<strong><em>Meta AI and Society:</em></strong> The world will be
				restructured around meta AI systems. Would you like to be in the
				room for that?
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong><em>Simulated creativity:</em></strong> Having a
					sense of aesthetics is dramatically more useful than being
					marginally more intelligent, and we are not letting our
					digital babies be without it.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						&quot;Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only
						truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere,
						like that of sculpture ... sublimely pure, and capable
						of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can
						show.&quot; 
						<br/>
						~ Bertrand Russell
					</p>
				</blockquote>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		<p><strong>We are Five, the leaders of a new frontier.</strong></p>
		<p>
			The goal here is for humanity to reach a technological singularity.
			To climb the Kardashev scale.
		</p>
		<p>For we are too late, and the stars are calling.</p>
